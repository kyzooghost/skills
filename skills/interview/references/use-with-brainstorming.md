/superpowers:brainstorm interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, system design, bottlenecks, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. Make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and relentlessly interview me about anything you are unclear about. Once clear about the plan, write it with /superpowers:write-plan (ensuring it heavily follows /test-driven-development for implementing new features)
