Follow the user instructions and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, system design, bottlenecks, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. Make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and relentlessly interview me about anything you are unclear about. Once clear about the plan, write the spec to a Markdown file.  <instructions>$ARGUMENTS</instructions>
